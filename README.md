This is my final year project. Machine learning based approach to detect and count trees. 
A method is proposed for the automatic classification and count of trees using RGB images obtained via a commercial Unmanned Aerial Vehicle, a Ryze Tello quadcopter drone. The dataset used for the train- ing of the Deep Convolutional Neural Network is curated using there different kind of images: Aerial imagery with field of view of 180 degrees (Parallel to the tree), Street view imagery (Perpendicular to the tree) and Drone captured imagery with field of view of 87 degrees (Diagonal to the tree).
Two solutions, one local and the other cloud based, are formulated where each yields an average detection of 77 % and 93 %, respectively. Publicly available packages for deep learning like tensorflow, darknet, opencv and pytorch are used to construct an intelligent vision system capable of localizing and counting trees from aerial imagery. Pertinent to mention is the lack of expensive sensing devices in our implementation, a stark shift from many of the previous studies along with demonstrable detection re- sults with excellent potential for scalability of the proposed solution to work with hyper-spectral sensory data.
